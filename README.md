Our team Algo-Rhythms has decided to make a project based on crime detection and prevention. Through our website, any person can record any video, and this video get analysed by machine learning algorithms. Our website would give a score based on the extremeness of the situation, and the video would be queried to the selected admin based on this score.
We have also used the most optimised way of scheduling videos to different admins because we have implemented queuing in the form of a max heap. This means that the more tense the video, the higher the score it gets, and the more quickly the admin sees the video and sends for help.
We have also prevented users from uploading their own videos and the location is also obtained from the webpage and not entered by the user so as to prevent the user from abusing the system.
